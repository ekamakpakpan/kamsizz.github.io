Blossom Bank also known as BB PLC is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, headquartered in London, UK.

Problem: Blossom Bank wants to build a Machine Learning model to predict online payment fraud

I carried out exploratory data analysis to make sense out of the dataset. I performed some feature engineering including encoding and scaling variables.
Then I modelled, train and test my data. Finally, I evaluated my trained model using several matrices. 

The logRegression model along side with the confusion metrics was the preferred model to use for evaluation and test for accuracy.

In conclusion, the Confusion metrix has an accuracy of 99%, precision of 95% and specificity of 99%. Therefore, it is the best in predicting BB Fraud.

Recommendation: The business should be more concerned with better results from false negatives than True positives.
